1.What does matrix multiplication represent geometrically?
sol: Geometrically matrix multiplication is just transformation of a vector from one form to another. this is done by multiplying vector with matrix(i-hat and j-hat columns). if two or more vectors are being multiplied,
     then this means that they are being applied over one another.we consider the right most transformation to be applied the earliest and follow the order.
